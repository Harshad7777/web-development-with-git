//why use express
it is web framework to build website
http package has limited capability such as not able to serve static files
also implementing security from starting
after building server how to manage things
handling get and post requests need to write custom code
who wants to do that a lot
then why am I using express

//set up server
main.js


// restart server  automatically
npm i --global nodemon


//initiate project
 npm init -y


//main.js automatically restart server
nodemon main .js 


//install express
npm i express

//install multiple virsion of express like 4
npm i express@4
